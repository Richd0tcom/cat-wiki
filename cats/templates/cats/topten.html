                <p class="text-lg font-meduim mt-2">With its long silky coat and bright blue eyes, it's no wonder the ragdoll tops the list as the most popular cat breed for the fourth year in a row. Living up to its namesake, the ragdoll is known to go limp in your arms and will soak up all the love and cuddles you have to offer.</p>

                <p class="text-lg font-meduim mt-2">These large cats have even more to love! Better yet, they have a lot of their own love to give and are highly regarded as one of the friendliest cat breeds you can find. </p>

                <p class="text-lg font-meduim mt-2">Though they bear a strikingly similar resemblance to their parent breed, the Persian, the exotic is evidently more popular, likely due to their low-maintenance manes. Minimal upkeep is required to keep these felines looking—and feeling—fancy.</p>

                <p class="text-lg font-meduim mt-2">Flat faces and long, flowing fur make the popular Persian one of the most recognizable breeds around the world. Despite their regal appearance, Persians don't need a whole lot to be happy and are often most satisfied cuddled in your lap.</p>
